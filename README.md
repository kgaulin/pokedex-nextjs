# Pok√©dex

Pokedex-nextjs is an application based on the new Nextjs 13 app router and tailwind. It uses the open source pokemon api to create a pokedex that allows you to search by name and scroll through the list of pokemons in number order. I was inspired by the figma https://www.figma.com/community/file/979132880663340794 to make the user interface.
